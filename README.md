### **SqlDelight**

- SqlDelight can be used for various platforms such as Android, iOS, web etc. The initial setup of
  SqlDelight is not as easy as Room but also not difficult.
- If you need to know more about SqlDelight, please read the documentation or [my article](https://github.com/kasem-sm/RocketXDelight-Playground#-medium-artcile).

### **Content of the app**

- We will initially fetch a list of rockets from [_*SpaceX
  Api*_](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/rockets) using Ktor.
- We will
  then [cache the data](https://github.com/kasem-sm/SpaceXDelight-Playground/blob/master/app/src/main/java/kasem/sm/delightplayground/interactors/GetRocketsUseCase.kt)
  using SqlDelight and display it.
