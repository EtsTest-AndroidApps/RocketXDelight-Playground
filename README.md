###   ***Why SqlDelight and Ktor?***
- Unlike Room Database which is only specific to Android, SqlDelight can be used for various platforms such as Android, iOS, web etc, the initial setup of SqlDelight is not as easy as Room but also not hard!
- Ktor? Yah, Retrofit is also cool but let's explore as Ktor is also not specific to Android.

###   **What's the app about?**
- Well nothing fancy, we will initially fetch a list of rockets from [_*SpaceX Api*_](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/rockets) using Ktor.
- We will then [cache the data](https://github.com/kasem-sm/SpaceXDelight-Playground/blob/master/app/src/main/java/kasem/sm/delightplayground/interactors/GetRocketsUseCase.kt) using SqlDelight and display it.
